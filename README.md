# Insurance Cost Prediction - Linear Regression Model

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a linear regression model to predict insurance costs based on features such as age, BMI, the number of children, smoking status, and region. The project follows a structured workflow that includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building.

## Introduction
Insurance companies use a variety of factors to determine the cost of insurance premiums. This project aims to predict insurance costs using a linear regression model. The main goal is to determine which features have the greatest impact on predicting insurance charges.

## Data
The dataset contains the following features:
- **age**: The age of the individual.
- **sex**: Gender of the individual (male/female).
- **bmi**: Body Mass Index, providing an indication of whether a person is underweight, normal weight, or overweight.
- **children**: The number of children covered by the insurance plan.
- **smoker**: Whether the individual is a smoker (yes/no).
- **region**: The region in which the individual lives.
- **charges**: The insurance charges billed to the individual.

## Project Workflow
The following steps outline the flow of the project:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Investigate summary statistics for numerical data using `describe()`, box plots, and histograms.
   - Perform univariate analysis on categorical data (e.g., gender, region, smoking status) using count plots.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values (if any).
   - Remove or handle outliers, if needed.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Convert categorical features like `smoker`, `sex`, and `region` to numeric using **one-hot encoding** or **label encoding**.
   - Standardize features like `age`, `bmi`, and `children` to ensure that all features are on a similar scale, especially for linear regression.

4. **Model Building**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Build a linear regression model using the training data.
   - Evaluate the model using metrics such as **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared**.

5. **Feature Selection and Model Tuning**:
   - Analyze feature importance and evaluate how each feature contributes to the model's performance.
   - Fine-tune the model if needed.

## Model Evaluation
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: The average squared difference between predicted and actual values. In this project, the MSE is 0.38, which suggests the error is moderate, depending on the target variable's range.
- **R-squared**: The R-squared value is 0.67, indicating that 67% of the variation in insurance costs can be explained by the features.

## Skills Used
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib` or `seaborn` (for visualizations)
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the dependencies with the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
